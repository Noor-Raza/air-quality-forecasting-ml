# Barcelona Air Quality Monitoring and Prediction

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** and **cloud-based deployment** can be applied to tackle a real-world problem: forecasting **urban air quality**.  

Using Barcelona‚Äôs open environmental data, I built a **prediction pipeline** that:  
- Processes raw time-series and weather data  
- Trains and evaluates multiple ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Elastic Net, SVM)  
- Provides **daily air quality forecasts** (PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, etc.)  
- Generates **health recommendations** based on predicted pollution levels  
- Delivers results through a **Flask-powered web application** with a clean UI

## üéØ Why This Project Matters to Recruiters

This project highlights my ability to:  
- **Work with messy real-world data** (cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values)  
- **Apply ML techniques** for forecasting and model evaluation (R¬≤, MSE, MAE)  
- **Build end-to-end solutions** ‚Äî from data science in Jupyter notebooks to serving predictions via Flask  
- **Communicate results** effectively through a web app and presentation slides  
- **Think in terms of impact**, offering actionable insights for citizens and policymakers

## üåç Project Overview

Air pollution poses serious health risks, yet real-time and predictive tools are limited.  
This project solves that by offering:

- **Real-time air quality monitoring** from Barcelona‚Äôs Open Data API  
- **Short-term prediction** of pollutants (e.g., NO2, PM10) using ML models  
- **User recommendations** (e.g., avoid outdoor activity on high-pollution days)  
- A **simple web interface** for tourists, delivery workers, and local citizens  

The project was developed as part of a **Cloud Computing final project** at ESADE (December 2024).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Sources**  
   - Weather & Air Quality data from [Barcelona Open Data API](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat)  
   - Pollutants monitored: PM10, NO2, O3, etc.  

2. **Machine Learning**  
   - Data preprocessing: remove missing values, add temporal features (day, month, etc.)  
   - Models tested: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Elastic Net  
   - Final model selected based on performance (R¬≤, MSE, MAE)  

3. **Web Application**  
   - Users input a date (day, month, year)  
   - Flask backend calls the trained ML model  
   - Prediction, health behavior, and pollution scale are shown dynamically on the webpage
